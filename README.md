FastMath - Fast Mathematical Function Approximation

FastMath is a lightweight, header-only C++ library providing a fast approximation for the exponential function exex. It uses polynomial fitting and clever bitwise manipulation techniques to deliver high performance with reasonable accuracy, inspired by methods detailed in https://quadst.rip/ln-approx.

Features
- Fast evaluation of exex for float and double types.
- Uses compile-time polynomial coefficient fitting.
- Template-based and header-only for easy integration.
- No external dependencies aside from the standard library.
- Customizable polynomial degree for trade-off between speed and precision.
